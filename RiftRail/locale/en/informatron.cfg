page_main_text_1=Welcome to [font=default-bold][color=193,128,255]Rift Rail[/color][/font]! This mod offers a compact, high-tech logistics solution, allowing you to seamlessly teleport trains across vast distances, different surfaces, and even spaceships.
page_main_text_2=Unlike traditional bidirectional connections, Rift Rail utilizes an [font=default-bold][color=orange]asymmetric, one-way teleportation system[/color][/font]. It flawlessly supports locomotives, cargo wagons, fluid wagons, and artillery wagons. Players inside the train are teleported instantly too! Please check the left menu for detailed operation guides.

title_rr_pairing=Operation Modes and Pairing Guide
page_pairing_text_1=Place a [item=rift-rail-placer] (Rift Rail Placer). Open its GUI and configure it as either [color=green]Entry[/color] or [color=orange]Exit[/color].\n\n[font=default-bold]How to Pair:[/font]\n1. Make sure you have built both an Entry and an Exit.\n2. Open the GUI of one portal, select the other portal from the "Target Selector" dropdown menu, and click the [color=green]Pair[/color] button.\n3. Once successfully paired, trains driving into the Entry will instantly emerge from the connected Exit.

# -- Routing Logic --
menu_rr_routing=N-to-M Routing
title_rr_routing=N-to-M Routing Priorities
page_routing_text_1=As of v0.10, Rift Rail supports complex [font=default-bold][color=green]Many-to-Many (N-to-M)[/color][/font] networks! You can connect 1 Entry to up to 5 Exits simultaneously, or multiple Entries to 1 Exit.\n\nWhen 1 Entry is connected to multiple Exits, the portal decides the destination based on the following [color=orange]priority[/color]:
page_routing_text_2=[font=default-bold]1. Circuit Control (Highest):[/font] If the train schedule has a wait condition `[virtual-signal=riftrail-go-to-id] > [Target ID]`, the train will precisely teleport to the Exit with that specific ID.\n\n[font=default-bold]2. LTN Auto-Routing:[/font] If it is an LTN train, the system will automatically calculate the distance and teleport to the closest connected Exit on the destination surface.\n\n[font=default-bold]3. Default (Fallback):[/font] If no instructions are given, it will teleport to the first available Exit in the connection list.

# -- LTN --
menu_rr_ltn=LTN Integration
title_rr_ltn=LTN Cross-Surface Setup
page_ltn_text_1=As of v0.10, the cross-surface LTN setup logic has been updated. To establish a valid LTN route between Surface A and Surface B, you must strictly follow these rules:\n\n[font=default-bold]1. Two-Way Round Trip (Hard Requirement):[/font]\nThe LTN dispatcher needs to calculate a return path to successfully dispatch trains. You must build [color=green]Entry A -> Exit B[/color] (e.g., Nauvis to Vulcanus), AND a reverse path [color=orange]Entry C -> Exit D[/color] (e.g., Vulcanus to Nauvis).\n\n[font=default-bold]2. Manual Independent Activation:[/font]\nUnlike older versions, the switch now ONLY affects the building you clicked. You must open the GUI for ALL [color=red]4 portals[/color] involved and [color=green]manually enable[/color] the "LTN" switch on both entry and exit sides.\n\n[font=default-bold]3. Universal Network (ID -1):[/font]\nTo simplify configuration, the custom portal network ID feature has been removed. All Rift Rail portals now permanently use [color=purple]Network ID -1[/color], acting as universal bridges for all LTN networks.

title_rr_faq=Frequently Asked Questions
page_faq_text_1=[font=default-bold]Q: Where is Cybersyn support?[/font]\nA: Due to architecture conflicts, Cybersyn support has been [color=red]permanently removed[/color] in v0.10. Please downgrade to v0.10.1 (N-to-M) or v0.8.2 (1-to-1) if you strictly require it.\n\n[font=default-bold]Q: Trains crash and don't teleport, or colliders are broken?[/font]\nA: Please go to [Settings -> Mod settings -> Map] and click [color=orange]"Reset all colliders"[/color] for an emergency fix.\n\n[font=default-bold]Q: Will uninstalling this mod corrupt my save?[/font]\nA: Before uninstalling, you MUST check [color=red]"Uninstall cleanup"[/color] in the Mod Settings. This forces the disconnection of all portals and cleans up residual data to prevent save corruption!
