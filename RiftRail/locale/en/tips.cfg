item-description-rift-rail-placer=Starting from v0.10, Rift Rail supports complex [font=default-bold][color=green]N-to-M[/color][/font] networks! You can connect 1 entry to up to 5 exits, or connect multiple entries to 1 exit.\n\nWhen 1 entry is connected to multiple exits, the portal will determine the train's destination based on the following [color=orange]priority order[/color]:\n[font=default-bold]1. Signal Control (Highest Priority):[/font] If the train's schedule wait conditions include the virtual signal [virtual-signal=riftrail-go-to-id] > [Target ID], the train will be teleported to the corresponding ID exit with precision.\n\n[font=default-bold]2. LTN Auto-routing:[/font] If it's an LTN train, the system will automatically calculate the distance between exits and the destination, and teleport to the nearest available exit on the same surface.\n\n[font=default-bold]3. Default Order (Fallback):[/font] If there are no instructions, the train will default to teleporting to the first available exit in the connection list.\nFor players seeking ultimate performance in mega-bases, Rift Rail offers deep optimization potential:\n\n[font=default-bold][color=orange]Tip 1: Utilize "Straight-through" Clone Optimization (Most Powerful)[/color][/font]\nIf after teleportation the train [color=green]does not need to change absolute orientation[/color] (e.g., entry faces north, exit faces south, train goes straight through), the system will intelligently call the ultra-fast Clone API. In this case, teleporting an entire train full of cars [color=green]consumes almost no UPS[/color]!\n[font=default-bold]Conclusion:[/font] When planning main lines, try to keep entry and exit [color=orange]facing opposite directions (straight in and out)[/color].
