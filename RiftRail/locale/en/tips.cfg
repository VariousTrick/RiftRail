item-description-rift-rail-placer=Starting from v0.10, Rift Rail supports complex [font=default-bold][color=green]N-to-M[/color][/font] networks! You can connect 1 entry to up to 5 exits simultaneously, or connect multiple entries to 1 exit.\n\nWhen 1 entry is connected to multiple exits, the portal will determine the train's destination based on the following [color=orange]priority[/color]:\n[font=default-bold]1. Signal Control (Highest Priority):[/font] If the train schedule's wait condition includes the virtual signal [virtual-signal=riftrail-go-to-id] > [Target ID] (the signal only considers the numeric value, not the symbol <, =, or >), the train will be precisely teleported to the corresponding ID exit.\n\n[font=default-bold]2. LTN Auto Routing:[/font] If it's an LTN train, the system will automatically calculate the distance between exits and destinations, teleporting to the nearest available exit on the same surface.\n\n[font=default-bold]3. Default Order (Fallback):[/font] If there are no instructions, the train will default to teleporting to the first available exit in the connection list.\nFor players with massive bases seeking extreme performance, Rift Rail offers deep optimization potential:\n\n[font=default-bold][color=orange]Tip 1: Utilize "Straight-Through" Clone Optimization (Most Powerful)[/color][/font]\nIf after teleportation the train [color=green]does not need to change absolute orientation[/color] (e.g., entry facing north, exit facing south, train goes straight through), the system will intelligently call the ultra-fast Clone API. In this case, teleporting an entire fully loaded train [color=green]almost consumes no UPS[/color]!\n[font=default-bold]Conclusion:[/font] When planning main lines, try to keep entry and exit [color=orange]facing opposite directions (straight in and out)[/color].
