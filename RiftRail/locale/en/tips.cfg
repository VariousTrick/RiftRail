item-description-pairing=The core mechanism of Rift Rail is [font=default-bold][color=green]pairing[/color][/font]: each entry must be connected to at least one exit to function properly. Once paired, when a train enters the entry, it will be teleported to the connected exit.\n\nTo pair: click on the [font=default-bold][color=green]Rift Rail Core[/color][/font], then click on the exit you want to connect to complete the pairing. Each entry can connect to multiple exits, and each exit can also connect to multiple entries.\n\nAfter pairing, the corresponding IDs will be displayed on the entries and exits (to help you identify their connections).

item-description-advanced=From v0.10, Rift Rail supports complex [font=default-bold][color=green]N-to-M[/color][/font] networks! You can connect 1 entry to up to 5 exits, or connect multiple entries to 1 exit.\n\nWhen 1 entry is connected to multiple exits, the portal will determine the train's destination based on the following [color=orange]priority[/color]:\n[font=default-bold]1. Signal Control (Highest Priority):[/font] If the train's schedule waiting condition includes the virtual signal [virtual-signal=riftrail-go-to-id] > [Target ID] (the signal ignores symbols and only looks at values, <, =, or > have no effect), the train will be precisely teleported to the corresponding ID exit.\n\n[font=default-bold]2. LTN Auto Routing:[/font] If it's an LTN train, the system will automatically calculate the distance from exits to destinations and teleport to the nearest available exit on the same surface.\n\n[font=default-bold]3. Default Order (Fallback):[/font] If there are no instructions, the train will default to teleporting to the first available exit in the connection list.\nFor players with giant bases pursuing extreme performance, Rift Rail offers deep optimization potential:\n\n[font=default-bold][color=orange]Tip 1: Utilize "Straight-Through" Clone Optimization (Most Powerful)[/color][/font]\nIf after teleportation the train [color=green]does not need to change absolute orientation[/color] (e.g., entry facing north, exit facing south, train goes straight through), the system will intelligently call the blazing-fast Clone API. In this case, teleporting an entire fully-loaded train [color=green]consumes almost no UPS[/color]!\n[font=default-bold]Conclusion:[/font] When planning main lines, try to keep entry and exit [color=orange]facing opposite directions (straight in and out)[/color].
