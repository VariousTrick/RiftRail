rift-rail-pairing-tutorial=Rift Rail Tutorial
item-description-pairing=The core mechanism of Rift Rail is [font=default-bold][color=green]pairing[/color][/font]: each entry must be connected to at least one exit to function properly. Once paired, when a train enters the entry, it will be teleported to the connected exit.\n\nTo pair: click on the [font=default-bold][color=green]Rift Rail Core[/color][/font], then click on the exit you want to connect to complete the pairing. Each entry can connect to multiple exits, and each exit can also connect to multiple entries.\n\nAfter pairing, the corresponding IDs will be displayed on the entries and exits (to help you identify their connections).

rift-rail-advanced-routing=Rift Rail Advanced Routing
item-description-advanced=Starting from v0.10, Rift Rail supports a complex [font=default-bold][color=green]many-to-many (N-to-M)[/color][/font] network! You can connect 1 Entry to up to 5 Exits, or connect 5 Entries to 1 Exit.\n\nWhen 1 Entry is connected to multiple Exits, the portal determines the train's destination based on the following [color=orange]priority[/color]:[font=default-bold]1. Signal Control (Highest Priority):[/font] If the train's schedule wait condition includes the virtual signal [virtual-signal=riftrail-go-to-id] > [Target ID] (the comparator <, =, or > doesn't matter, only the value), the train will be teleported precisely to the matching Exit ID.\n\n[font=default-bold]2. LTN Auto-Routing:[/font] If it's an LTN train, the system automatically calculates the distance between the Exits and the destination, teleporting it to the closest available Exit on the same surface.\n\n[font=default-bold]3. Default Fallback:[/font] Without any instructions, the train defaults to the first available Exit in the connection list.\nFor megabase builders pushing for maximum performance, Rift Rail offers deep optimization potential:\n\n[font=default-bold][color=orange]Same-Axis Placement[/color][/font] As long as the paired Entry and Exit are [color=green]both placed vertically, or both horizontally[/color], the portal bypasses complex standard spawning logic and directly calls the native Clone API for pixel-perfect duplication. This method consumes almost zero UPS and is the top choice for megabases![font=default-bold]Conclusion:[/font] For optimal teleportation performance, please avoid 90-degree "one horizontal, one vertical" setups. Keep the portals [color=orange]parallel[/color] whenever possible.
